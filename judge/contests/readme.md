<h1>Contest Overview</h1>
This project is in progress and aims to implement a Contest Management system for coding contests. The system will eventually allow users to participate in coding contests, submit solutions, and view results. The following features are planned for future implementation:

<h2>Contest Creation</h2>
Admin users will be able to create new contests by specifying the name, description, and duration.

The contest will be made visible to all users for participation.

<h2>Contest Participation</h2>
Registered users will be able to participate in contests by submitting solutions to coding problems.

Submissions will be evaluated, and results will be made available once the contest ends.

<h2>Results and Leaderboard</h2>
After the contest ends, users will be able to view the results and rankings based on their performance.

A real-time leaderboard will be provided, updating as submissions are made and evaluated.

<h2>Security and Integrity</h2>
All contest data, including submissions and results, will be securely stored.

Secure session management will ensure that only authorized users can access contest-related data.

These features are currently being developed and will be added in future updates.

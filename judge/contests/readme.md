<h1>Contest Overview</h1>
This project is in progress and aims to implement a Contest Management system for coding contests. The system will eventually allow users to participate in coding contests, submit solutions, and view results. The following features are planned for future implementation:

Contest Creation
Admin users will be able to create new contests by specifying the name, description, and duration.

The contest will be made visible to all users for participation.

Contest Participation
Registered users will be able to participate in contests by submitting solutions to coding problems.

Submissions will be evaluated, and results will be made available once the contest ends.

Results and Leaderboard
After the contest ends, users will be able to view the results and rankings based on their performance.

A real-time leaderboard will be provided, updating as submissions are made and evaluated.

Security and Integrity
All contest data, including submissions and results, will be securely stored.

Secure session management will ensure that only authorized users can access contest-related data.

These features are currently being developed and will be added in future updates.
